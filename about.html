      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p>My name is Fabio Tricarico.</p>
      <p>I have had a passion for video games and the gaming industry since I was a child, and have garnered an interest in gaming journalism since my teenage years.</p>
      <p>More info on myself would be that I grew up in the Edgemead suburb of Cape Town and attended Edgemead High School.</p>
      <p>After finishing high school, I decided to join the workforce and began working at Global Load Control as a Load Controller dealing with short and long-distance commercial flights.</p>
      <p>I then decided to get my degree in Psychology and English at Pearsons Institution of Higher Education, which I completed <em>cum laude</em> in 2021.</p>
      <p>I feel the passion I have for gaming and the skills I acquired due to my English degree have made me apt in researching and writing informative as well as well-constructed news articles.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the constant growth and change within the industry means that informative journalism is essential as individuals wish to be updated on the latest developments in the ever-growing industry.</p>
